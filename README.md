### ANALYZING DATA:
One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

I am interested in women passenger survival. My goal was to explore the survival rates for women overall, comparing male and female survival. Also, survival based on their traveling class (upper, middle or lower). And lastly - survival based on 2 groups of age - adult and child.
